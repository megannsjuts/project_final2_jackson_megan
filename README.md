[HTML5 Boiler Plate Code](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/blob/master/src/css/main.css#L107-L169)

I used the visually hidden code from this source to hide the headers that are
for screen readers only.

Everything else I referenced was from lectures or notes.

# Deductions

I reviewed the list of deductions for this project and in the syllabus.

# Comments

I am not sure if the links for the W3C Validator or the HTML5 Outliner are
working correctly, so I will also include screenshots of these with my submission
on Canvas.
